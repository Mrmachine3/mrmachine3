### ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!
#### âš¡ Fun fact: 
I'm a Warhammer 40k hobbyist and I enjoy building and painting miniature figurines when I'm not building upon my technology side projects. Therefore, as appropriate within the lore of Warhammer 40k I'd certainly be a Techmarine with the following specialities (not official 40k terms...just listing for fun):

```bash
whoami
echo "Security Logistician"
echo "Blue Squad Cybersmith"
echo "Linux Tech-Adept"
echo "Python Lexmechanic"
echo "General Tech-Errant"
```

#### ðŸ”­ Current Project:
- Building my home lab to run containerized workloads consisting of security monitoring services and infrastructure automation tools: 
  - Elastic stack - log harvesting agents, log ingestion/parsing/enrichment pipelines, search analytics engine, and data visualization application stack
  - Zeek - a network security protocol analysis solution
  - The Hive - a security incident response and case management application
  - Hashicorp Packer - a machine image building tool for software packaging
  - Ansible - an automation tool for deploying and provisioning resources


#### ðŸŒ± Current Learning Objectives:
- Iâ€™m currently learning the following:
  - Python for data analysis, information security, and network administration
  - Ansible for infrastructure configuration management, information security orchestration, and network administration
  - Elastic stack management techniques to develop new kibana visuals, SIEM detections, and logstash log source parsers
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will advance my skills as a SIEM and threat detection engineer focused on host-based and network-based intrusion scenarios.
