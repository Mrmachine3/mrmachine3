### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
#### âš¡ Fun fact: 
I'm a Warhammer 40k hobbyist and I enjoy building and painting miniture figurines when I'm not building on my technology side projects. Therefore, as appropriate within the lore of Warhammer 40k I'd certainly be a Techmarine with the following specialities (not official 40k terms...just listing for fun):

```bash
echo "Security Logistician"
echo "Azul Squad Cybersmith"
echo "Linux Tech-Adept"
echo "Python Lexmechanic"
echo "General Tech-Errant"
```

#### Current Projects:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my home lab to deploy the following security projects to develop system administration skills and adhere to DevOps mindset and CI/CD workflow:
  - Elastic stack - log ingestion pipeline, search analytics engine, and data visualization application stack
  - Moloch - a packet capture (PCAP) index application for network security analysis
  - The Hive - a security incident response and case management application
  - Security Onion - a network security monitoring and alerting solution

#### Current Learning Objectives:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the following:
  - Python for data analysis, information security, and network administration
  - Ansible for infrastructure configuration management, information security orchestration, and network administration
  - Elastic stack management techniques to develop new kibana visuals, SIEM detections, and logstash log source parsers


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project that will advance my skills as a SIEM and threat detection engineer focused on endpoint and network intrusion scenarios.
